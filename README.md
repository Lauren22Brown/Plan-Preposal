# Plan-Preposal

# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

 I was thinking of a visual novel based game.



## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Lauren Edgar

## Do you have any questions of your own?

N/A
# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Implantation (a play on infestation)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I will create a game in which the player grows a plant. The plant will become overgrown and evil by the end. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

     I will be using Pygame to create a visual novel in which the player will point and click options to nurture their plant. The plant will eventually become overgrown and start clicking fertilizer options for the player with its own roots. The plant becomes uncontrollable and covers the screen resulting in a game over. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Lauren Edgar, tuq12896@temple.edu, TA- Elmira 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

All clickable options work
Music and sound effects play
Artwork is captured correctly 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can create the drawings
The lines for the player to say
The options
And pick out music 
Get through half of coding 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope that the project is fully functional, and I can have my dad play through it as he is a computer science guy and he would be proud of me. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to get comfortable with pygame and begin the drawings.
